React UI for interacting with backend API server. The input form takes two inputs - a Shopify site URL and keyword to search for.

The site should be in URL format with `https://<site_name>.com`.  
Search will look for items names that contain the keyword, so the keyword does not need tobe an exact match with what you want to find  

Access to the bot is blocked by a login page. Use password `coffee`
